| Aspect                | Classification                | Description                                            | Example                        |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Learning Type         | Supervised                    | Learns from labeled data                               | Regression, Classification     |
|                       | Unsupervised                  | Learns from unlabeled data                             | Clustering, Association        |
|                       | Reinforcement Learning        | Learns by interacting with the environment, receiving rewards/penalties | Game AI like AlphaGo          |
| Unsupervised Learning  | Classification                | N/A                                                    | N/A                            |
|                       | Regression                    | N/A                                                    | N/A                            |
| Training Approach      | Batch Learning                | Trains on the entire dataset at once                  | Traditional training methods    |
|                       | Online Learning               | Trains incrementally as new data arrives              | Real-time prediction systems    |
| Algorithm             | Instance-Based Learning       | Learns from specific instances of the training data   | K-Nearest Neighbors            |
|                       | Model-Based Learning          | Learns a model based on the training data             | Decision Trees, Neural Networks|
