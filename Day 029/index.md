## Mapping

### Overview of self-organizing maps (SOM) :
Introduction,need for som,when to use som,key concepts,use cases in unsupervised learning

what are neurons in SOM ? : What are the diff b/w neurons in som and neurons in other neural networks?,how neurons work in som: wright vectors,learning process,neighbourhood function,
competetive learning and topology preservation
(Quantization error,topographic error,som distortion measure,topographic product,silhouette score,u-matrix,hit histogram): description,interpretation

Self-organizing MAp (SOM) : kohonen self organizing maps,neural gas algorithm


## Kohonen self organizing maps
Defination,assumptions,mathematical formulation : step 1: initialization,step 2: finding the best machine unit (BMU),step 3:update the weights:neighbourhood function, step 4: repeat the process.
how to use,when to use,pros and cons,use case.examples,intution/visualization,comparison,evaluation metrics,complexity,real world challenges,code implemetation,variants and extension: batch som,
convolutional som,limitations in real world applications

## Neural gas algorithm
Defination,assumptions:dimensionality,metric space,topology,mathematical formulation,how to use: data prep,initialization,training,shopping criteria,when to use,pros and cons,use case,
example: numerical example,adaption of neural gas algorithm using minisom library,variantas and extensions,limitations in real-world applications
