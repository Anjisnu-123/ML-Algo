Linear support vector machines (SVM)

Used for classification tasks. They work by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes in the feature space. 

wT*x +b=0

The margin is defined as the distance between the decision boundary (hyperplane) and the nearest data points from either class. 

importance : maximizing the margin and robustness to noise

Objective function, optimization process, regularization, statistica interpretation, evaluation metrics


when to choose linear SVM : margin and decision boundary: (svm,logostic regression),Nature of data : (svm,logostic regression),underlying mathematical basis :(svm,logostic regression),overfitting and regularization : (svm,logostic regression), interpretibility : (svm,logostic regression),performance with imbalanced data: (svm,logostic regression).
