What is recommender system,why are recommender system needed,Key concept in recommender system:User pref,item features,personalization,cold start problem:when there is insuff data about new users,user item matrix,industry use cases: Ecomerce platform,streaming service,social media platforms,online news and content provider,job portal,Metircs used in recommender system:
`[ MAE,RMSE,precision,recall,F1 score,Hit rate : (number of hits/Total number of users),interpretation,Diversity,serendipity: it measures how surprising or unexpected the recomendations are,Novelity,Mean resiprocal rank (MRR),normalized discounted cumulative gain,Personalization<logarithmic loss ]` : for alll this: [] calculation,interpretation

Collaborative filtering:user based,Item based,matrix factorization: singular value decomposistion,Alternative least square,content based filtering

User-based collaborative filtering : Defination,assumptions,mathematical formulation : {step 1: user item interaction matrix,step 2: computing user similarites,preprocess the data,filter for common items,caclualte cosine similarity},How to use,When to use,pros and cons,Use case,intution/visualization,comparison,evaluation metrics,complexity,real world challenges,code implementation

Item based collaborative filtering : Defination,Assumptions,Mathematical formula {step 1: user item interaction matrix,step 2: computing user similarites,step 3: prediction },How to use
When to use,pros and cons,use case, intution,comparison,Evaluation metrics,complexity,real world challeneges,code implementation,varriants and extension,Limitations in real world application

singular value decomposistion : Defination,assumption,mathematical formulation,how to use,when to use,pros and cons,use case,svd calculations,intution/visualization,comparison,evaluation metrics,complexity,real world challenges,spftware implementation,variants and extension,limitations in real world application
